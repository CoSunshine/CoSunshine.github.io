I'm a second year PhD student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/), [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/). My research interest includes software testing, security and privacy of web-based system.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guangdong Bai](https://baigd.github.io/), who currently lead the [TrustLab@UQ CSS](https://trustlab.uqcloud.net/). Prior to my PhD student journey, I obtained my Master's degree from National University of Sinagpore and Bachelorâ€™s degree from Dalian University of Technology, both majoring in computer science.

During my spare time, I enjoy swimming and biking.
